The Open Reporting Object Model (OROM) proposes a standardized, JSON-based approach to reporting, addressing challenges posed by fragmented, platform-specific solutions. OROM enables reports to be defined once and used across various platforms—ensuring consistency, efficiency, and ease of maintenance. Through this unified model, reports can be displayed in web, mobile, and desktop environments while maintaining a consistent structure. The model’s benefits include cross-platform compatibility, streamlined maintenance, and a cohesive user experience for reporting across applications. OROM offers a future-oriented solution that minimizes redundancy and supports fast, flexible reporting across the organization.
